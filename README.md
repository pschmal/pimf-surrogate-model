# pimf-surrogate-model
A multi-scale, multi-fidelity approach for predicting the fluid flow velocity and pressure fields in porous media

How to run:
Utilize the notebook files in the root directory.
Run-Time-Hybrid-MF-Proposed.ipynb is the best performing model, which takes advantage of the multi-fidelty data and our proposed sequential U-net PINN architecture.
The other notebooks are the other models summarized in Table 1 and 2 of our manuscript.

Folder contents:
High is a subset example of the high fidelity dataset.
LG-3C is examples of microstructure geometry for multi-fidelity models.
LG-3C2 is examples of microstructure geomtery for zero-fidelity models.
Low is a subset example of the low fidelity dataset.
Validation is a subset example of our validation dataset.
